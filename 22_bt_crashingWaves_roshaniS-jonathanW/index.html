    <h2> 1. Navbar </h2>
    <p>
      This feature of prebuilt navbars in Bootstrap is a very handy feature for every website that needs a navigation bar.
      <br><br>
      <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/navbar/#supported-content">Here</a> is where we got 
      this code, but we also tweaked it and removed some things.
      <br><br>
      The overall navbar is spanned by a navbar class. The background color (navy) is set by adding it in 
      the style attribute in the nav tag. The color scheme of dark is set by adding "navbar-dark" in the class 
      attribute of the nav tag. Using "container-fluid" allows the navbar to span the entire width. Using 
      "navbar-nav" styles the navbar so that all the items are in a row. This is used in 
      the class attribute of the ul tag. This is also used to align all the items to the left and resizes the navbar
      properly. "nav-item" is used for adding items to the navbar. "nav-link" is used to add links to the navbar in the same 
      style as the rest of the navbar. "active" and "disabled" can be used to specify the properties of these links. 
      <br><br>
      If you make the window smaller (and it is encouraged to do so!), the links collapse on top of each other. 
    </p>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark" style="background-color: navy;">
      <div class="container-fluid">
        <ul class="navbar-nav">
          <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#">Active link</a>
          </li>
          <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#">Working link</a>
          </li>
          <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link disabled">Disabled link</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </nav>
    <br>
    <h2> 2. Grids </h2>
    <p> 
      This feature is best used for organizing elements of a page in a specific format. In this 
      case, the chunks of text are aligned next to each other
      <br><br>
      <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/grid/#example">Here</a> is where we got the code. 
      We changed the text. 
      <br><br>
      This is a very simple example, but look at how the columns are all next to each other. This is done through the 
      adding "container" to the class attribute in the div tag. 
      <br><br>
      If you resize the window (please do!) you can see that the columns stay next to each other and 
      don't collapse on top of one another.
    </p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            This is a column. 
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            Adding "row" to the class attribute of the div tag allows the columns to 
            all appear next to each other.
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            The style of the columns are governed by adding "col" to the class attribute of
            the div tag.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <h2> 3. Cards </h2>
      <p> 
        This next feature is best used for displaying information concisely as well as putting a link 
        to redirect the user elsewhere if needed.  
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/card/#using-grid-markup">Here</a> is where we got the 
        code. We removed the buttons and changed the text. 
        <br><br>
        Again, rows and columns are used to organize these cards. However, we will focus on the cards 
        themselves. 
        <br><br>
        Cards basically appear how you would expect them to. They have light borders and contain elements 
        within them. Adding "card" in the class attribute of the div tag creates a card. "card-body" 
        organizes the elements in the card. "card-title" styles the card's title. "card-text" styles the 
        card's text below the title. 
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h5 class="card-title">Title is in bold!</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Supporting text is below the title. The button below can take you to a link!</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h5 class="card-title">This card is next to the other one.</h5>
              <p class="card-text">This is because of the "row" class.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
  </body>
</html>
