K14: Form and Function - Notes for app.py
2021-10-15

-- Predictions and Notes
The `from flask import request` line, we think that it will allow us to access a form request.

We don't know what exactly will print when we print the app object, but it likely will contain information about the flask app. After running the app on localhost, it prints out "<Flask 'app'>", which is just the name of the Flask app.

The request object contains information about the form request from when the user clicks the submit button in a form. It contains the request method used.

We think (and after running the app, we see) that request.args is a dictionary that contains all of the input values of the form submitted by the user. 

In the `disp_loginpage` function, request.args will likely be empty, since the user hasn't submitted anything yet, so printing request.args['username'] will likely result in an error. It results in a KeyError.

We have no idea request.headers does. Maybe it is a list of the form input names. After running app.py, we see that there is a bunch of information that gets printed out, such as the host, platform being used, and connection.

Once the user presses submit on the root localhost page, they will get redirected to the localhost:5000/auth page.

In the authenticate function, the page will just show "Waaa hooo HAAAH", but in the terminal, when request.args is printed, it will show the username typed by the user from the previous page. It will actually show a dictionary with inputted values.
