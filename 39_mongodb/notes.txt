Notes for Chapter 5 of MongoDB 101:

Aggregation Framework:
- another way to query data in MongoDB
- db.<collection>.aggregate([{$match: {}}, {$project: {}}])
- $group
    - operator that takes incoming stream of data, then siphons it into multiple distinct reservoirs
    -  {$group: {
        _id: "", // Group By Expression
        <field1>: {<accumulator1> : <expression1>},
        ...}}
- $sum

sort() and limit():
- cursor methods
- db.<collection>.find().sort({<field1>: 1, <field2>: -1})
    - orders data based on specifications
    - 1 is increasing, -1 is decreasing
- .limit() specifies the amount of results 
- cursor.limit().sort() means cursor.sort().limit()

Introduction to Indexes:
- index in a database
    - special data structure that stores a tiny portion of the collection's data set in a form that is easy to traverse
    - single field and compound
- db.<collection>.createIndex({<field>: <number>})
- compound index
    - used for multiple queries

Introduction to Data Modeling:
- data modeling
    - way to organize fields in a document to support your querying capabilities and application performance
    - rule: data is stored in the way that it's used
    - main considerations
        - what we'll store
        - how it will be queried
    - data that is used together should be stored together
    - evolving application --> evolving data model

Upsert - Update or Insert?
- db.collection.updateOne({<query to locate>}, {<update>})
- upsert: hybrid of insert and update - should only be used when needed
    - db.collection.updateOne({<query>}, {<update>}, {"upsert":true})
    - if upsert is true:
        - update document when there is a match
        - insert document when there isn't a match
    - upsert:true
        - be mindful about this decision
        - conditional updates
        - good for upsert if both answers are yes:
            - is {<update>} enough to create a new document?
            - will the document have similar/same form to other documents in the collection? 
    - upsert:false
        - just update existing document or insert new document
