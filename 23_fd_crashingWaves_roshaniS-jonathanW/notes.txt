DISCO:

We discovered that the callouts in Foundation could be formatted different, so there
are various ways to input text onto the website as well.

We also then learned that Foundation, like BootStrap, also has 'warnings' and 'alert'
descriptors for their div ids and classes.

The navbar creation in Foundation appeared to be easier than BootStrap. In addition to that
the various ways to create buttons were pretty interesting.

Q/C/C:

One main concern that we had we were that some of the features listed were either
not clear or not written correctly. For example, the default colors were listed
on their on-ramp, but it was not specified how it could be done. The next thing
was that their expanded button description was wrong. We had to add a class = 
expanded button for it to work and for type it had to be button, not expanded button.

Overall, the tutorial was pretty organized and easy to follow. 

What other features are useful and interesting in Foundation?

Q0:
We consulted their html file because parts of their tutorial were incomplete or incorrect.
Other than that, we did not consult any other resources.

Q1:
We like Foundation better at this point because it seems easier to read and understand.
