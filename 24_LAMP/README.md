### Estimated Time Cost: _

### Prerequisites:

- Have a GitHub account and obtain a GitHub Student Developer Pack. 
- Know the type of droplet you will need beforehand to make provisioning one quicker and easier.

1. Log into DigitalOcean with your GitHub account. 
2. Create a droplet with these parameters:
    - Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64
    - Basic droplet (Shared CPU) 
    - Regular Intel ($5 per month)
    - A datacenter in New York
    - Choose SSH keys for authentication and follow the instructions on the side for how to create and/or add one
3. Go through the steps for creating and adding a sudo user on this [page](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-new-sudo-enabled-user-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart), which is also under "Resources."
    First, enter this command:
    ```
    # adduser <username>
    ```
    Then, answer the questions that are presented to you.
    Lastly, enter this command to add the user to the sudo group:
    ```
    # usermod -aG sudo <username>
    ```
4. Access your droplet 
    - If you want to access the droplet via a terminal, ssh as root to your ipv4 address and say yes for the fingerprint and you should be in.
        ```
        $ ssh root@<ipv4 address>
        ```
    - example: 
        ```
        $ ssh root@159.65.236.192
        ```
5. Install Apache
