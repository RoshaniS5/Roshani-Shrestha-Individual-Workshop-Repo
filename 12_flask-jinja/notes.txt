K12: ...or The Only Constant is Change? - Notes on app.py in 12_flask-jinja

Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line? 
Predictions:
If you remove render_template from this line, the return statement on line 16 will not run. There will be an error because render_template won't be 
imported and thus will not be defined. Therefore, model_tmplt.html will be unable to be served from localhost.

Results:
It worked as predicted.

Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
Predictions:
Yes, the URL is http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template. 

Results:
The URL is correct.

Q2: What is the significance of each argument?
Predictions:
The first argument is the file name that is served from localhost as a template. The second and third arguments are variables in the template.
The second argument is the value that replaces foo in model_tmplt.html. In this case, it is "fooooo". This becomes the title. The third argument 
is the value that replaces collection in model_tmplt.html. In this case, it is coll, which is a list of numbers ([0,1,1,2,3,5,8]). This appears in
the body of the page. 

Results:
It worked as predicted. Basically, the second and third arguments define variables that jinja can use to insert text into the template. These variables 
can be of any type (ex: strings, ints, lists, dictionaries, etc.).
