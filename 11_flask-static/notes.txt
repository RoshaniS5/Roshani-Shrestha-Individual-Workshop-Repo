K11: Some Things Never Change - Details predictions and results of the files in 11_flask-static
2021-10-07

Predictions:
For foo and foo.html, accessing files via localhost:5000/ doesn't work unless flask is being run / a server is being hosted. The app.py file will 
produce very similar results to previous app.py files analyzed. After opening the link, it will print "the __name__ of this module is... " 
in the terminal followed by __name__ which is "__main__". On the browser, "No hablo queso!" is printed. Debug mode is on, so refreshing the page 
will display changes quickly. 

Results: 
It worked as predicted. The browser could not connect to the links in foo.html and foo.
In addition:
1. Accessing foo (plaintext file) via the localhost link downloads the file
2. Accessing foo.html (a webpage) via the localhost link renders the webpage instead
