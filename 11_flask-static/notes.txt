# K11: Some Things Never Change - Details predictions and results of the files in 11_flask-static
# 2021-10-07

Predictions:
For foo.html, http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html doesn't work unless flask is being run. For foo, http://localhost:5000/static/foo will also not work. 
The app.py file will produce very similar results to previous app.py files analyzed. After opening the link, it will print "the __name__ of this module is... " 
in the terminal followed by __name__ which is "__main__". On the browser, "No hablo queso!" is printed. Debug mode is on, so refreshing the page 
will display changes quickly. 

Results: 
It worked as predicted. The browser could not connect to the links in foo.html and foo.
